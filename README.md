coin-flipping-puzzle
====================

Consider 10 coins arranged in a line with the head side facing up. Players move in turn.

In a move, a player must turn 1, 2, or 3 coins, with the following restriction:
the rightmost coin to be turned must be a head (thus, it will be turned from head to tail).

The goal of the game is to have each coin with the tail side facing up.
The player who achieves this with his or her move wins the game.

When the game is started the program must ask for the names of the players.

The program must store the result of the games as follows.
For each game, the following information must be stored: the date and time when the game was started,
the name of the players, the number of moves made by the players during the game, and the name of the winner.

The program should be able to display a high score table in which the top 5 players with the most wins are displayed.

You can store data a database, in a JSON file, or in an XML document.
Optionally, you can implement load/save game functionality.
